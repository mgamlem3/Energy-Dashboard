# Energy Dashboard
## Purpose
This project will take data given to it from various utility meters on Whitworth University's Campus and display it in graph form. It will store the data on private servers to allow the data to be compared year over year.

There will also be a private portal that authorized users will be allowed to use that will give detailed reports and more information. This will be used by Facilities to help manage energy usage on campus.
